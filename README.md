### Analytical computation of subduction-driven flow in a spherical shell

The Python code necessary to run models, plot pressure fields, and compare modeled and 'observed' dips

### folder contents:

dip_observations: Use Slab2 (Hayes et al.) to derive the dip 'observation' catalogue used in Holt and Royden (2020, G-cubed).

flow_computations: Use a range of provided model geometries to compute analytical pressure fields, compute synthetic model dips, and compare with the observed dips.
