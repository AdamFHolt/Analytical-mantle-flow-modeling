### This directory contains scripts necessary to compute upper mantle pressure and flow driven by subduction in a spherical shell (Holt and Royden, 2019)

The main driver script is global_pressure_withPressurePlot.py, which computes pressure for an input plate and slab model (location in inputs/) and plots the pressure field (into plots/)
